# Demo, uplink android
1. To demonstrate the use of the uplink android library, ensure that you are in the `main` branch of the repository.
2. Build the `.aar` package containing the uplink library.
3. Copy the package from the `/lib/build/output/apk` directory and paste it in the `app/libs` directory of the `demo` branch.
4. Now you can use it to run uplink on your android device by writing an android activity to initiate and interact with.
